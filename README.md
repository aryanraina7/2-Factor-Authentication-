# 2FA Project

## Project Description

This project is a secure Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) system developed using PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Bash, and an Auth-API for generating TOTP (Time-Based One-Time Passwords). It allows users to generate OTPs with any authentication app like Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator for enhanced security.

## Technologies Used

- PHP
- MySQL
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- Bash
- Auth-API

## Features

- Generates TOTP (Time-Based One-Time Passwords)
- Compatible with popular authentication apps (Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, etc.)
- Enhances user security by requiring a second factor for authentication

## Advantages of TOTP 2FA

1. **Increased Security**: TOTP 2FA provides an additional layer of security by requiring a time-sensitive one-time password in addition to the user's regular password.
2. **Protection Against Phishing**: Even if an attacker manages to steal the user's password, they cannot access the account without the TOTP generated by the user's authentication app.
3. **Offline Availability**: TOTP does not require an internet connection to generate the one-time password, making it reliable even when the user is offline.
4. **Wide Compatibility**: TOTP is supported by a variety of authentication apps, giving users the flexibility to choose their preferred app for generating OTPs.
5. **Time-Based**: The one-time passwords are time-based and expire after a short period, reducing the risk of reuse or interception.

## Usage

1. Register on the website and enable 2FA in your account settings.
2. Scan the QR code provided using any TOTP-compatible authentication app (e.g., Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator).
3. Enter the generated OTP from the app to complete the 2FA setup.
4. During subsequent logins, enter the OTP from your authentication app after entering your password.
